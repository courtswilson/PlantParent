# Plant Parent:seedling:

Making being a plant mama or papa easier!

## Development

### Objective

Create an application which is compatible on multiple operating systems. The applicaiton will notify the user when it is time to water their plants and take care of them in other ways which may be required. A user will be able to populate a database with the plants they own along with the plant care information that comes with them. 

## Plan

The current plan for the application is for a user to create an account and then customise their *plant shelf* by selecting the plants that they own from the database and adding them to their shelf. They can then refer to their virtual plant shelf for care and maintenance. 

### Checklist

 - [ ] Plan how the database will look and the information it will hold
 - [ ] Create blank database for user to populate
 - [ ] Create an application which can populate database. 
 - [ ] Further develop application send notifications to user.
